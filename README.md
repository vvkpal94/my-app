Step 1 - Download vs code
Step 2- We'll be using the create-react-app generator for this project.
To use the generator as well as run the  React application server, you'll need Node.js JavaScript runtime and npm (Node.js package manager) installed. npm is included with Node.js.
Step 3-
Create a folder name react, inside it create another folder name project 
This pc/new volume E/react/project
Then press shift + right click, this opens the terminal and after that write the below command 
npx create-react-app my-app
where my-app is the name of the folder for your application. This may take a few minutes to create the React application and install its dependencies. 
Now open my-app in vs code. How? 
Open vs code 
Add folder and then add this my-app folder and save workspace as vivek folder

Step 4
-Let's quickly run our React application by navigating to the vivek folder and typing npm start to start the web server and open the application in a browser:
cd my-app 
npm start
Step 5-You should see the React logo and a link to project on http://localhost:3000 in your browser. We'll leave the web server running while we look at the application with VS Code.
